SERP Helper extension makes it easy for our team to help debug and fix issues you have by sending us the information we need to debug your issues (without asking you to manually go find a whole bunch of technical things and send them to us).

## How to use

1. Install the extension in your browser (same process as installing any of our other extensions)
2. Visit the page where you experienced an issue/bug with one of our other extensions (be sure to refresh the page if you already have it open)
3. Click the extension & enter the email you use with SERP
4. Click "Send support bundle" and let support know it was sent!
